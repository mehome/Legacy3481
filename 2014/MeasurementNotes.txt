In testing with a 5.426 degree pitch on camera I can still track ball around (4.5*12)-13=41 inches.. 3.416 from the end where camera is, and
about 5 degrees of freedom on each side.  3.9 gives about 6.7 degrees of freedom so we may want to be about 4 or 5 feet away for tracking to
be effective.

29 degree decline... or 61 (where 90 is straight up)... this will extend out 12.6 so that is when the ball has first contact... which from
centerpoint is starting contact with bumper.

This means we'll need to plan 4-5 feet out and drive straight back that much with no more information after the 3.4 mark.
