I've put the binaries in this link:

When using a web browser you'll see release... and in there you have 3 Dll's and one exe
These files end up in this folder... where this folder (where this ReadMe) is located here:

.\Code\2016\2016Dashboard

This folder needs Video1.lua (included in this folder) which is the first thing Dashboard.exe reads
It controls the overall settings of the vision.
I have this file set to run the compositer which in turn runs the processing vision... we can change
Compositor_Main.lua in regards to what overlay we want to see with the camera.

I currently have this setup to display a black window with a square
