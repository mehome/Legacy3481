DetailsView_ColumnLayout::DVCL_ForceVerifyColumns()
Line 324 have it call an overloaded RowCollection to get a column name given a detailsview element

The overloaded StoryBoard_Layout or VideoEditor_LayoutSB (rowcollection) will need to get the ci by casting to
a BaseSB_DetailsView_Element... 

Have it call a new function which gets the crouton... and then type subtract BasicSB_DVElem_NumItems and num of ci local 
assets.. if it is negative it can return the info to indicate so

row collection will insert the File specifier from this as needed.


In storyboard crouton base... when it asks to get an element DVR_GetDetailsViewElement(columnname) it need to call the predecessor
of filebutton... with the File specifier taken off.
