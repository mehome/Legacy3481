1. Identify version of lua and check smart dashboard.

2. If lua is version 1.2 (working version) revert to 0.01 (FRC2015Robot_BACKUP.lua)

3. If problem persists check net console to be sure lua updated and code is running properly.

3. If problem persists use version 0.02 (FRC2015Robot_DEBUG.lua), this enables pid to help with debugging. Check net console to be sure lua updated and code is running properly and that the registered values are correct.

4. If problem persists check smart dashboard. If smart dash board shows correct values the code and lua are operating as expected. Begin looking for hardware fault.
