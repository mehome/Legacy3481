A list of somethings I was not entirely sure how to do that the driver wanted:

1. Decreasing deadzones without increasing magnitude
2. How to assign controls to the front buttons/axis triggers (for use as kicker wheel or feathering turning)

Also, I'll see about writing a powershell script or something to make it easy to deploy Lua, since they were having trouble doing for some reason when I was not there the first day.
